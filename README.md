While analysing the datasets, I found a total of 106 unique locations. Given such a higher number, it will be interesting to see whether there are significant disparities amongst the other variables when we consider each location. 

Looking at the top 5 locations with the highest number of records, we can see 2 parts of London appear in North East and North West. This is to be expected given the dense population within London. 

Finally, when looking at the different columns in detail, we can see that there aren’t many varieties in the columns. It may be more useful to look further into each specific value. For example, when looking at service settings, we can see that ‘General Practice’ has a slight majority with around 350,000 records. It is clear that that is the most demanded service and should be noted. Context has almost all records within ‘Care Related Network’ – this is certainly the most popular value. National category seems to be split more evenly as does appointment status.

Note that there are a significant number of ‘Unknown’ under appointment status. This should be noted since it shows a clear lack of understanding whether patients did or didn’t attend appointments and could reflect a huge amount of unnecessary costs.

Looking at the actual duration dataset, we can see that appointments were scheduled between 01/12/2021 and 30/06/2022. The national categories dataset contains appointments between 01/08/2021 and 30/06/2022. Both datasets end at the same date but the national categories dataset goes back an extra 4 months.

Looking at the number of service settings during the period of 01/01/2022 and 01/06/2022, we see that general practice had the most with 2104 and ‘Other’ followed with 1318. Only 152 were unmapped during this period. 

Looking at the number of appointments per month, we see that November of 2021 had the most appointments with 30405070. Just behind it was October of the same year and September was 4th highest. This suggests a consistent high demand for NHS services during that period. Interestingly the lowest month of appointments was August 2021.

Looking at total number of records per month, we see March 2022 have the highest with 82822. Second is November 2022 with 77652. While that corroborates with the high count of appointments in that month, generally there isn’t any correlation between the two subsets.
