**Assignment activity 2**

While analysing the datasets, I found a total of 106 unique locations. Given such a higher number, it will be interesting to see whether there are significant disparities amongst the other variables when we consider each location. 

Looking at the top 5 locations with the highest number of records, we can see 2 parts of London appear in North East and North West. This is to be expected given the dense population within London. 

Finally, when looking at the different columns in detail, we can see that there aren’t many varieties in the columns. It may be more useful to look further into each specific value. For example, when looking at service settings, we can see that ‘General Practice’ has a slight majority with around 350,000 records. It is clear that that is the most demanded service and should be noted. Context has almost all records within ‘Care Related Network’ – this is certainly the most popular value. National category seems to be split more evenly as does appointment status.

Note that there are a significant number of ‘Unknown’ under appointment status. This should be noted since it shows a clear lack of understanding whether patients did or didn’t attend appointments and could reflect a huge amount of unnecessary costs.
